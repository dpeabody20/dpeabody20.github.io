Hey, this is Flare Performance Calculator.

The goal of this project is to support aircraft performance computation in a modular way that allows additional aircraft to be added. Additionally, there should be a login feature which allows users to save N-numbers of their aircraft for quick/easy loadouts based on preferances. The system will support customization of aircraft, display-page layout, and user preferances like units of measurement or favorited aircraft/loading conditions.
