        <p>Welcome to Peabody's Performance Calculator. This page gives technical information regarding how the calculator works. Find an element you are curious about below.</p>
        
        <a href="index.html">Back to Calculator</a>

        <h3>Weight and Balance</h3>
        <h4>General</h4>
        <p>The PPC calculates all weights and CG locations for the following contidions: Ramp, Takeoff, Landing, Zero Fuel. While ramp weight is calculated, it is never displayed nor used for any warnings. All weights displayed are rounded to remove decimal places. Aircraft are assumed to have 6qts of oil for simplicity purposes. Takeoff weight assumes that 0.5 gallons of fuel were burnt on taxi. At least 5 gallons of starting fuel are needed for the calculator. This is only to remind the user in the event they forgot to add fuel when entering loading information. If 'Fuel Use' is set to anything less than 5 gallons, fuel use is instead set to 5 to avoid the appearance that the landing weight is greater than the takeoff weight since the takeoff weight includes the taxi burn.</p>

        <h4>Manual Entry of Aircraft</h4>
        <p>This feature, which is selected by default, allows the user to specify their own empty weight or CG for an aircraft. This is intended to be used if a particular aircraft has different empty values than those listed, or if there are new UVU aircraft which haven't been added to the database yet. The manual entry option assumes that the aircraft has a baggage configuration of 'B' (See AFM 6-6) and is equipped with a long-range tank. The max landing weight is assumed to be 2535lb, so if the aircraft has a reduced max landing weight, the calculator will not automatically warn the user.</p>
        
        <h4>Baggage</h4>
        <p>Baggage compartments use station locations described in AFM 6-6 for configuration types A, B, or C which vary by aircraft.</p>

        <h3>Aircraft Speeds</h3>
        <p>All speeds, after calculation, are rounded to remove decimal places. With the exception of maneuvering speed and the rotate speed for takeoff, all speeds are calculated using linear interpolation using the values provided in the AFM. Vr is always 59 and Va is calculated with the formula: Va(at max gross weight) * sqrt(landing weight / max gross weight). It should be noted that the landing weight is used for Va, so if the aircraft is flown lighter than this, Va will be lower than indicated. It should also be noted that the AFM uses a bracket style system for determining Va, so values may not perfectly match.</p>
    
        <h3>Takeoff/Landing Distance</h3>
        <p>Takeoff and landing distance calculations assume that no wind is present (a headwind will only improve distance) and that a dry, asphalt surface is used. If headwind corrections are desired, the user may use the AFM charts as follows:</p>
        <p>
            1) Begin at the end of the chart with takeoff roll distance prvided by the calculator (not the distance over a 50' obsticle).
            <br>2) Draw a line directly to the left until reaching the beginning of the 'WIND COMPONENT' where it reads 0kts
            <br>3) Continue to follow the chart as normal including a headwind or tailwind.
        </p>
        <p>Both takeoff and landing distances use takeoff weight for calculation. This will provide more accurate landing distance information for pattern work or an aborted takeoff. The calculations are made using linear interpolation between all of the lines visible in the AFM charts. Field elevations anywhere from -1000ft to 12000ft can be used, although these extremes are not recommended. Additionally, temperatures can also be used down to -40, although the AFM only provides values down to -20. With this being said, if any atmospheric calculation would cause the line to exceed the top of the window for the AFM chart, the calculation will be cancelled for high density altitude. For calculating the distance over a 50' obsticle, a simplified mathmatical representation is used instead of interpolation.</p>

        <h3>Pressure/Density Altitude</h3>
        <p>Altimiter setting must be positive, but there are not other checks on this, so excercise caution to not mis-enter a value like '2.992'. Likewise there are no checks on the temperature. If any value is left blank, it is inputed as '0'. Pressure altitude is determined using the simplified equation: field elevation + ((altimiter setting - 29.92) * -930).</p>
